  Troubleshooting
  ---------------
  If your image doesn't show in the browser, it's due to the Flash Player
  security sandbox. First of all, you should know that when you upload your
  image onto a server, everything will work just fine.
  Nonetheless, if you wish to test your content locally you can do so by going
  to the Adobe Flash Player Global Security Manager and adding your output folder
  to the trusted locations:
